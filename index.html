                        <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
                        <p> I am a UX/UI designer with a strong background in graphic design and fine arts. I specialize in design for both digital and print and enjoy any creative problem-solving that comes my way! In my experience, I have worked closely on cross-functional teams including copywriters, content strategists, and sales teams. I have worked on three rebrands and have led two of those, working closely with the creative director and CEO. Â My skills include branding, user-centric market research, user flows, site analysis, wireframing, and prototyping. </p>

                            <div class="p2">My career so far has revolved around creating impactful customer-facing collateral. Doing this successfully has only possible through thorough research online and user research methods like A/B testing and survey forms. Recently I have also begun to experiment with interviews derived from in depth UX research plans, contextual inquiries, card sorting, and usability testing.</div>

                            <div class="p2">Traditionally, I have created user personas based on industry research and insight about our real customers, gathered from the sales teams in order to get into the mindset of our real customers. Using methods like user personas and empathy maps have allowed me to tap into needs, wants, and motivations of our users so that I can alleviate their frustrations through the proper Information architecture.</div>
