                        <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
                        <p> I am a UX/UI designer with a strong background in graphic design and fine arts. I specialize in design for both digital and print and enjoy any creative problem-solving that comes my way! In my experience, I have worked closely on cross-functional teams including copywriters, content strategists, and sales teams. I have worked on three rebrands and have led two of those, working closely with the creative director and CEO. Â My skills include branding, user-centric market research, user flows, site analysis, wireframing, and prototyping. </p>
